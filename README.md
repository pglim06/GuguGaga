# 1. Project Overview

## The Problem
Modern group travel planning is paralyzed by fragmented tools, rigid itineraries, and conflicting companion preferences. The primary stakeholders are designated trip leads and squad members who bring differing physical stamina, dietary restrictions, and mobility requirements. While market solutions like Wanderlog map static pins and Splitwise logs retrospective debts, they fall critically short by failing to harmonize real-time logistics with human group dynamics. They cannot dynamically branch itineraries based on individual paces, coordinate step-free and allergy-safe alternatives, or provide automated weather contingencies.

## Our Solution
Wayfarer is an all-in-one collaborative squad travel concierge that transforms chaotic group escapes into cohesive, stress-free journeys. By unifying bookings, interactive mapping, multi-currency budgeting, and individual accessibility needs into a single responsive dashboard, it eliminates the need to juggle multiple disconnected travel apps. Its centerpiece innovation, the "Split & Reconnect" Compromise Engine, solves group pacing dilemmas by letting travelers divide into parallel daytime tracks and automatically reuniting them at sunset with zero wait time. Combined with dynamic "Plan B" weather contingencies and smart debt minimization, Wayfarer ensures every member travels on their own terms while keeping the squad united.

### Feature Set
* "Split & Reconnect" Squad Compromise Engine: Enables 1-click member vibe allocation between high-energy and chill tracks, synchronized parallel schedules, and automatic sunset convergence at a mutual evening landmark.
* Dynamic "Plan B" Weather Contingency System: Detects incoming weather disruptions and provides 1-tap indoor activity substitutions that preserve the overall schedule and geographic proximity.
* Interactive Timeline and Geo-Spatial SVG Map: Vector canvas with transit duration calculations, walking routes, landmark pins, and hover tooltips.
* Multi-Currency Budget Tracker and Debt Settlement Graph: Simplifies tangled multi-party balances into minimal direct transfers with live conversion across multiple currencies.
* Centralized Booking Manager and Live Price Tracker: Consolidates lodging, transit, and activity passes with confirmation codes and price trend tracking.
* Squad Hub, Democratic Voting and Accessibility Profiles: Ingests dietary and mobility requirements to guide routing, while enabling squad upvoting on wishlist destinations.
* Wayfarer AI Travel Concierge: Context-aware destination assistant offering local etiquette tips, packing lists tailored to forecast climates, and contextual recommendations.

## 2.3 Mentor Consultation


| Date | Mentor | Feedback Received | What Was Changed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 13/9 | Iris Yan  | • Advised against building a live booking engine with direct checkout, as it introduces unnecessary API complexity and engineering overhead; suggested keeping it strictly as a confirmation and voucher repository.<br>• Pointed out that our initial feature list felt too similar to existing market apps, lacking a distinctive hook to grab the judges' attention.<br>• Noted that our presentation video was far too text-heavy (~80% text on screen) and needed to show interactive product walkthroughs instead.<br>• Commended the overall completeness and visual polish of the prototype. | • Scoped down the Booking Hub to a centralized digital voucher and confirmation-code vault (with live price change indicators) rather than an OTA booking platform, keeping technical scope feasible.<br>• Elevated the "Split & Reconnect" Compromise Engine to our primary flagship hero feature, establishing immediate differentiation from traditional planners.<br>• Overhauled our pitch video and presentation slides by cutting text down to ~20% and replacing dense paragraphs with UI screen interactions, branching flowcharts, and live feature walkthroughs. |
| 13/9 | Looi Wei En | • Cautioned that having too many scattered features made the product feel unfocused; urged us to anchor the pitch around one primary core idea.<br>• Validated that our solution strongly aligns with the core problem statement of companion friction in group travel.<br>• Praised our UI design as clean and organized, but suggested adding an onboarding flow to guide first-time travelers through setting up squad preferences.<br>• Specifically highlighted the "Split & Reconnect" feature as exceptionally unique, standout, and compelling. | • Streamlined our entire value proposition to center around the "Group Pacing Dilemma," positioning Split & Reconnect as the hero solution and reframing all other modules (budget, weather Plan B, voting) as supporting pillars.<br>• Designed an onboarding squad-setup experience where members define their mobility constraints, pacing preferences, and dietary needs before generating their branching itinerary. |

# 3. What Makes It Different

* "Split & Reconnect" Squad Vibe Compromise Engine: Traditional itinerary planners assume a monolithic group moving in lockstep. Wayfarer introduces an automated branching timeline where members split into Explorer (strenuous ascents, high step counts) and Chill (step-free, shaded cafes) tracks, then automatically calculates walking and transit buffers to reunite both squads at a shared evening anchor spot at the exact same time.
* Plan B Weather-Triggered Contingency Swapper: Instead of travelers manually scrambling when rain hits, Wayfarer pairs live weather forecasts directly with activity indoor/outdoor metadata, serving a 1-tap curated indoor swap that preserves the schedule and geographic proximity.
* Accessibility-First Squad Profiles: Structured member profiles (step-free mobility, dietary restrictions) act as active system constraints, automatically guiding low-mobility travelers to the Chill Track and filtering safe restaurant stops.
* Democratic "Want-to-Go" Wishlist: Eliminates chat debates by allowing companions to drop dream spots into a shared bucket and cast upvotes/downvotes, providing clear consensus before days are finalized.
* Unified In-Trip Financial Ledger: Merges schedule context with an algorithmic debt minimization engine, consolidating multi-currency expenses into the minimum number of transactions alongside reservation vouchers.

# 4. Technical Architecture & Feasibility

## Tech Stack
**Frontend framework:** React 19 with TypeScript 5.7  
* **Pros:** Offers the latest performance optimizations, seamless modern component rendering, and strict type safety that catches errors before running the app.  
* **Constraint:** Components must be default exports. All markup elements and brackets must be strictly closed. Apostrophes inside single-quoted strings must be avoided or escaped to prevent compilation errors.

**Build tooling:** Vite 8 with the React Vite plugin
* **Pros:** Delivers near-instant local server start-up, ultra-fast hot module reloading when editing files, and rapid code formatting.  
* **Constraint:** The development server is pre-managed and runs on a dedicated port in the background. Path shortcuts are tied to the source directory, and preconfigured workspace build plugins must remain intact.

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with the Tailwind Vite plugin  
* **Pros:** Generates tiny CSS bundles with zero manual CSS build steps, providing modern styling rules and fast responsive layout creation.  
* **Constraint:** Does not use traditional styling configuration or preprocessor files. Custom fonts and theme variables must be placed directly at the top of the main global stylesheet.

**State management:** Native React 19 Hooks (`useState` and `useMemo`)  
* **Pros:** Built directly into the runtime without adding external package bloat, keeping data flow predictable and easy to trace.  
* **Constraint:** No third-party state managers like Redux or Zustand are installed. All shared app data must be stored in the root view and passed down to screens through component properties.

**Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)  
* **Pros:** Gives you a powerful relational database out of the box with built-in user authentication, file storage, and instant real-time data sync for group planning.  
* **Cons:** Complex relational schemas can take more time to design upfront compared to document databases, and unused free projects are paused after inactivity.

**AI & LLM Service:** Gemini API (Google AI Studio)  
* **Pros:** Offers a generous free tier, huge context limits to read entire trip plans at once, and fast processing speeds.  
* **Cons:** Rate limits on the free tier can be tight during peak times, and safety filters can occasionally block harmless travel queries.

**APIs and Services Used**

**API Mapping Service:** Mapbox  
* **Pros:** Generous free tier with highly customizable, beautiful map themes that seamlessly match modern app designs.  
* **Cons:** Its place search and opening hour data are not as rich or reliable as Google Maps.

**Weather Service:** OpenWeatherMap API  
* **Pros:** Industry standard with dependable hourly forecasts and weather alerts worldwide.  
* **Cons:** Hourly and multi-day historical data often require a paid subscription.

**Currency Service:** Frankfurter API  
* **Pros:** Completely free, easy to use, requires no API key, and supports over 200 currencies with reliable daily exchange rates.
* **Cons:** Exchange rates are updated daily instead of in real time, and rates may not update on weekends or public holidays.

**Hosting Platform:** Vercel  
* **Pros:** Effortless Git integration, automated preview deployments for every update, and blazing-fast global edge delivery.  
* **Cons:** Bandwidth limits on the free tier can be reached quickly if you host heavy image files directly instead of through cloud storage.
